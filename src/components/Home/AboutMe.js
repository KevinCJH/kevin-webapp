        I have recently graduated with the Bachelor of Computing in Computer
        Science (with Honours) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). I
        love to explore new technologies and is amazed at the technological
        advancements we've made in recent years. I have some experience in
        mobile app development and also web app development.

        My main interest lies in software engineering, UI/UX engineering and
        product development. Although my specialisation is software
        engineering, I have also taken a few courses related to UI/UX research
        which includes Interaction Design, Qualitative User Research as well as
        Quantitative User Research, as I believe that a well designed interface
        goes hand-in-hand with a well designed system.
